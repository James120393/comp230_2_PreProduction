##This is the readme for comp230 Pre Production task


The source code that I have done is in the comp230-2-1506530 folder.

The Game Executable is in the Project-VoT Folder. When in game you can either select start which will take you to our first level or you can click the mechanics testing which will demonstrate the basics of the game.

Click [Here](https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/project-vot/tree/James_Dev) for the repository for the game, there in the contents/blueprints folder you will fins all the visual scripting that has been created to go alongside the source code.
